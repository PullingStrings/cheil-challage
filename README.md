## Few things I wanted to do but where not in the word document

I would have liked to have had a pause and play overlay on the video
https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes

I would have loved to use react but I thought it best to leave it as it would be better to use it for the entire project as a posped to one component

There is two things, the averages background image is not the same width as the others?
and I didn't find the small screen for the screens, who ever sent me the asserts will know this, but it doesn't matter because this is all a test.

THANKS
